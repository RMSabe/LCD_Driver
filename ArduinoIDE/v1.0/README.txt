Generic Alphanumeric LCD Display Driver for Arduino IDE.
Version 1.0

This is a small driver I made for controlling alphanumeric LCD displays.
It's still basic, probably a lot of things can be improved, but it just works.

Yes, I know, Arduino IDE has their own alphanumeric LCD display driver called LiquidCrystal.h ,
but I work on other platforms as well, therefore I've created my own LCD driver. 
And since I've created it for other platforms, I thought of creating a version of it for Arduino IDE as well.
You're welcome...
